# Preparation Instructions for Running the Synthetic Data Pipeline

1. Clone the OmniParser repository:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser.git omni
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install -r requirements.txt -qqq
   ```
   This command will install all necessary dependencies listed in the requirements file.

3. Convert the model weights to PyTorch format:
   ```bash
   !python weights/convert_safetensor_to_pt.py
   ```
   This script will convert model weights from safetensor format to PyTorch format, ensuring compatibility.

After completing these steps, you will be able to execute the main pipeline script.

Note: Ensure that all paths and dependencies are correctly set up according to the instructions above before running the full pipeline.
